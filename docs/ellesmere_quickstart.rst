Ellesmere Django Quickstart
===========================

Scope
-----

Quick start with installed application to get back working on the job.

Get things going
----------------

Open ``conemu`` with 'Powershell'. Run `vi :Proj` and find code and docs.

To run the server and tests open ``cmd`` shell and move to conda env.::

        $ chdir C:\Users\cousinsd\AppData\Local\Continuum\Miniconda3\envs\ellesmere\school\school

Activate the environment::

        $ activate ellesmere

Start server::

        (ellesmere) $ python manage.py runserver

Run tests::

        (ellesmere) $ python manage.py test caretaking

Metrel
------

Metrel is the only reason for pushing on with MSSql. Mostly I'm now developing ``caretaking`` app
only.
